I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease.

The bristles are gentle on the skin, yet provide a thorough, deep pore cleansing.  The rotating head vibrates enough to be effecting, but not so fast that it feels like a grinding wheel and the entire package is easy to hold in your palm.  Great for control and being easy to reach all the areas of your face. The motor is powerful and does not get bogged down and the charge lasts a really long time. It has two speeds - one for extra gentle - but she rarely uses this speed.  Plus the entire package is waterproof.  To charge, just rest it in the cradle charger provided.\n\nMy wife like to use her preferred cleanser (not a bar of soap). Her recommendation is to keep the brush head clean and dry when not in use.  In other words, don't use it, put it down and just walk away.  Keep the head clean and make sure it dries really well between use.  She sets hers bristle down on a folded sheet of paper towel.

I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease.

It went on much smoother than the masks I am accustomed to using.  It felt creamier and got into difficult areas around nose and creases in neck.  Drying time really depends on oil content of your skin.  It actually took about 12 minutes to totally dry on my face, especially around my nose where I have high oil concentration.  It came off quite smoothly in the shower and did not get stuck in hairy areas of my mustache, eyebrows, and hair line.  It did provide me with an invigorating tingling feeling that I enjoy and seemed to remove blackheads well.\n\n\"The only thing prohibitive of regular usage would be the cost.

You apply it to your clean  face and neck avoiding the eye area.  It dries in 5 to 10 minutes.  You then remove it using warm water.\n\n\"I tried this product before my morning shower.  It went on much smoother than the masks I am accustomed to using.  It felt creamier and got into difficult areas around nose and creases in neck.  Drying time really depends on oil content of your skin.  It actually took about 12 minutes to totally dry on my face, especially around my nose where I have high oil concentration.  It came off quite smoothly in the shower and did not get stuck in hairy areas of my mustache, eyebrows, and hair line.  It did provide me with an invigorating tingling feeling that I enjoy and seemed to remove blackheads well.\n\n\"The only thing prohibitive of regular usage would be the cost.  My normal facial mask product is Queen Helene Mudd Pack or Mint Julep which sells for $4 for 8 ounces.  This product is $18 for 4 oz.\n\n\"On a scale of 1 through 10 I would give this product a 3.\""}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-1039", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I don't think this works for me"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-2772", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I want to start by saying I LOVE Oscar Blandi products...I've purchashed the glossing cream, serum & dry shampoo/spray numerous times however this product didn't do much.

Will be throwing out and getting something different.\n\nFirst, and perhaps not so important, this straighter does have a sleek look. It's lightweight and narrow, unlike some of the bulky straighteners I've owned in the past. This is a plus as it takes up less counter space and isn't an eyesore.\n\nThere is one button that controls on/off and the temperature of the device. Holding down the button turns it on/off, while double clicking allows for temperature control. Above the button there is a series of lights that change depending on the temperature and indicate that the straighter is heating vs ready to use. While, as far as I can tell, this type of control set-up does work, the different temperatures are not noted on the device. I use the same temp every time, so this doesn't affect me as much, but, if you might need to adjust the heat, you'll have to check the instructions pamphlet for temp ranges.\n\nI have admittedly thin hair, but it is naturally curly. I had no problem straightening the majority with only one pass, but some of the more finicky bits, like my bedhead bangs, took a bit more finesse.\n\nAs a plus, this straightener did come with two hair clips to divide and twist up hair when straightening.

It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.\n\nHere's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon\n-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)\n-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)\n-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner\n-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )\n**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**\n-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)\n-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum\n\n(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is \"Black don't crack\". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)\n\n***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.\n\nI hope this helped someone! I know it was a lot to read. Also, use smile.amazon.com to make your purchases!

And it burned my eyes a little. Must wash off after 10 mins, it leaves a sticky film. Not a terrible, but not my favorite.\n\nI tried four products, including this one, each for two weeks, 1x per day after face wash at bedtime.

It smells great, like all their products, and moisturizes like a dream!  The skin under my eyes has never ever felt SO SMOOTH and wrinkle free. I started using it on a couple other spots on my face because it minimizes wrinkles so well. Dark circles appeared lessened because of improved hydration, tone, etc.  This one was my clear winner.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Womens-Eye-Contour-Serum/dp/B0087CRJDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Womens Eye Contour Serum</a>\nBright white and thicker cream has virtually zero scent. It is very gentle and felt like nothing at all, so I wore this one under makeup during the day. It soaks in super fast and doesn't feel greasy, but lasts for hours. Definitely helped reduce puffiness. Maybe a bit on the dark circles, too.  Second choice. I'd buy this one again! Contains: eyeliss and haloxyl.

The scent is a little too strong, but still pleasant and floral. Left my skin feeling very smooth, and very moisturized at first, but didn't last long enough. One pump gel goes a very long way, so I ended up smearing most of it on my face. Not intense enough for my dry, baggy under-eye skin.

I never bought any because of the price, and, I am not all that self conscious about my balding anyway.  However when a good friend of mine got some for his thinning hair I was so impressed by how it good it looked that I begged him to let me use it just once.  The color wasn't exactly right but that didn't matter since it was only a test... Unfortunately I have to say that even though it worked very well on my friends hair that is only thinning, it was a total bomb for me who has a real beach head coming in on the top.  Quite simply, one has to pay very close attention to the description of how this stuff says it works.  It clearly states that it needs or works by bonding with your existing hair.  If you have either no, or hardly any existing hair, it just comes out looking like a lot of very homely fuzzy stuff.  I tried it all over the top of my head and it simply stuck to it, and then ended up looking like some kind of very short, fuzzy, sparsely covered type dog hair.  Very ugly and fake looking and not at all worth the price or the bother for sure....\n\nAs for how it worked for my friend I have nothing but praise.  It was amazing the way it blended in and stuck to what thinning hair he had and combed out looking completely natural.  If you really want to see how this stuff looks in use, type the name of it into google and go to videos.  There are several online that depict a true demonstration of how good this stuff works on thinning hair.  Even on very thinning hair.  But not a one I found showed someone with a real Dr. Phil look, or even just a completely bare bald spot.  Without some minimal hair to cling to you are like me, fresh out of luck and too late.  If my hair was only thinning I would consider the hefty price of this worth it I believe.  Just remember for the truly bald, its a bust...\n\nIn conclusion, I decided to take off one star on the rating simply because I feel that despite this working very well on thinning hair, I believe that the description should more forcefully state that its not for bald heads. I don't think it does clearly enough to satisfy me. Not even the manufacturers web site that has a more detailed description says anything about bald heads.  Personally I feel that the majority of the negative reviews of it comes from those that are too far ahead with hair loss and just came out with a big fail on their part.  It was with me for sure.  Highly recommended only  for those with thinning hair that this stuff can cling too, and that feel hiding it well is worth the price... : )"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-56091", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "When this works it's fine, but the replacement I originally ordered didn't work.

The label stays on and does not come off like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mario-Badescu-The-Moisture-Magnet-SPF-15-2-oz/dp/B0015Z532O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mario Badescu The Moisture Magnet SPF 15, 2 oz.</a>.\n\nHOW DOES THIS CLEANSING SOAP PERFORM?\nA little goes  along way of this stuff.  It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.\n\nI have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.\n\nIn both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.\n\nI have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.\n\nTHE WORST PART- ITCHING\nThe worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nGreat sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.\n\nI have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.  For us, it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-10653", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Stinks to high heaven.

By now you know that I am not only a licensed Hair stylist and Makeup Artist to some of the biggest names, but I am one of the most trusted on product knowledge. You also know that I am not paid for endorsements and I'm unbiased. Moroccan Oil was exciting when it first launched at our industry trade show, Premiere, in Orlando, Fl. They had demo's on the spot, and handed out mini sample bottles to everyone with their grubby little hands out, mine included. As I researched this product and its ingredients a little deeper, I discovered that it is only a subtle, temporary fix for giving a little smoothing effect to the hair. There is no long term benefits from using this product. Don't waste your money. Yes, it smells nice, but it's not what it claims to be. No, I'm not hating on Moroccan Oil. There is nothing wrong with using it if you are just looking for a subtle and temporary fix and don't mind spending the money. You could get better results with pure organic coconut oil (used in small amounts). Now that I've told you the truth about this product, I will be honest and say I love their hairsprays and glimmer shine spray. You'll have to read those reviews there. If you want an alternative to this oil, Orofluido is much better, smells better and has more lasting results. Be sure to read my reviews before purchasing any hair product. I will ALWAYS give you an honest, educated and professional review.

I have a light/medium skin tone and this looked very unnatural/whited-out on me. The formula is also a little greasier than I would normally like in a lip balm, and I'd love to see it with a bit more wax, heavier oils, or even some powder fillers to give it a little more thickness and longevity and a more even application (since mineral sunscreens need to be on in a thick and even layer to protect, and I can see just how unevenly it's applying since it's so light on me). I have taken to applying this over a sheer matte pink-toned lip color to balance some of the whiteness out.

It was working great for the first few days and then out of no where my skin reacted awfully. It made my eczema flare up and with a vengeance. I was itching from head to toe.

Tried their shamp/cond & bar soap products as well thinking the Tea Tree Oil line would be my cure-all for skin conditions and overall I'm thoroughly disappointed.\n\n[INITIAL REVIEW]: Wow I love this stuff! It's a great moisturizer! I don't think I'll use it as a leave in conditioner because I have long, fine hair and any product added usually just weighs my hair down & makes it feel greasy/heavy. So only reviewing as a skin moisturizer and dang this stuff is awesome! Wish I could underline lol! Awesome because of the smell (I know I'm going to lose a few people here, but I actually like the kind of minty, citronella candle smell), it absorbs quickly and thoroughly, which is definitely something that is hard to find. Even some lotions that say they absorb with no greasy feeling don't cut it and this stuff does! It seems to be helping my eczema! It's almost cleared up my arms and has nearly completely cleared up my hands including some hard, scaly patches that almost look like psoriasis, though I've never been diagnosed with that skin condition. I've used it all over my body and so far my only (very mild) complaint is, it made the skin of my face & neck break out so I will stick to Clinique products on my face, but everywhere else get's a nice, soothing coating of PM Tea Tree Oil Moisturizer. Next time I'm buying industrial size! It's working wonders for the cracks on the heels of my feet. Also just a FYI a little goes a loooong way!

It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.\n\nHere's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon\n-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)\n-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)\n-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner\n-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )\n**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**\n-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)\n-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum\n\n(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is \"Black don't crack\". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)\n\n***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.\n\nI hope this helped someone! I know it was a lot to read. Also, use smile.amazon.com to make your purchases!

I have dropped BD's from much higher and on tile and it still held up.

Never buying from their Amazon store again.\n\nOriginal Review: I got a sample when I was subscribed to Birchbox and loved it! I needed a clear lip product to apply before going to bed because I like the feeling of moisturized lips in the morning. I didn't really expect anything from this little tube, but I was blown away. The gloss isn't sticky or shimmery, it's just enough to hydrate your lips. I wear it in the morning, and again at night time, and I haven't had to exfoliate my lips since I started using this product. My lips feel plump and smooth all day long. My lipsticks have never looked better! It's the only lip product I have actually fully used up, this being my third tube.

The ad suggests that this is for 0.75 oz tube but has both pictures.  The item I received was the 0.5 oz pump.  My suggestion for anyone ordering is to not order from this company since it is not fully clear in what you will receive (my guess is that they may still have a few old tubes in the warehouse but they have labeled both of them the same).  I ordered this since I figured I would get a few extra ounces for only a few dollars more.  What happened was I spent a few dollars more and got the smaller bottle.

I have recommended them to clients with skin sensitivities and in most cases they have been very happy with their performance.  Once in a while, however, I come across a product which I am not as fond of.  This, unfortunately, happens to be one of them.\n\nWHAT IS THIS CLEANSER LIKE?\nA nice sized bottle, I do like the color of the cleanser.  It reminds me of pistachio ice cream.  The texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  It has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  The fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  I am not sure what it is.  It just is not a smell that I enjoy a whole lot.  The label stays on and does not come off like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mario-Badescu-The-Moisture-Magnet-SPF-15-2-oz/dp/B0015Z532O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mario Badescu The Moisture Magnet SPF 15, 2 oz.</a>.\n\nHOW DOES THIS CLEANSING SOAP PERFORM?\nA little goes  along way of this stuff.  It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.\n\nI have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.\n\nIn both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.\n\nI have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.\n\nTHE WORST PART- ITCHING\nThe worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nGreat sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.\n\nI have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.  For us, it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-66393", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Really like this brush, works great on many types of hair.

I have been working out a lot this year and counting calories, and I have lost more than 30 pounds.  I've been trying different anti-cellulite products to get a little extra help, appearance-wise.  I've been using this one for a few weeks now.\n\nIt is hard to tell if this is working.  I know that 95% of reducing cellulite is diet and exercise, so I have seen some improvement simply because of those factors.  I don't necessarily think any of it is due to this product in particular.  (I am just using this on the outer thighs and rear end, twice per day.  It is probably going to last about six weeks at the rate I am going, which is a reasonable period of time for a product of this size)  I am not noticing much change at all.  (In fairness, with other products, I do occasionally feel like I see a difference.)\n\nThe other thing is, I really don't like the oil format.  It doesn't absorb well into the skin at all and leaves a sheen of oil over where I've applied it, as well as on my hands.  There are some other body oils I use on occasion that don't have this problem.  But I really don't like the greasy feeling I get after I apply this.  (I ordered straight from Nuxe so I know I have a legitimate bottle of product.  The pump works well and it is plastic, which is nice -- I don't care for body care products in glass bottles, which can break very easily in *my* bathroom.)  Also, you do have to massage this in for a long time -- that's in the instructions on the package.  So this may not be for impatient people!\n\nIt is not causing any irritation or sensitivity-type reactions, so that's good.  I don't notice a strong smell or really any scent at all.  (I have constantly clogged sinuses, though, so maybe I am not the best judge...)\n\nPlease note this has some tree nut and sesame-derived ingredients, so avoid if you have those allergies.  You can see the full ingredients list if you zoom in on the product images.\n\nIn the end, you will get the most results from diet and exercise.  For supplementary purposes, I find massage with a cellulite massager and coffee scrub in the shower on the affected areas, plus using a body cream containing retinol twice a day to be most effective.

Being a veteran weeaboo, the first safety razor I tried was some legit Japanese stuff (forgot the brand, sorry) paired with Feather blades.  I have delicate, sensitive little girl's skin marred with big red-black thick quasi-Lovecraftian double-sprouting beard hairs; surely some sort of punishment for past-life atrocities.  After using the Japanese blades, my face was left as bloody as a Tarantino movie set in the after-hours.  I thought I'd get the hang of it with practice.  I didn't, and ended up giving up and going back to selling my internal organs in order to afford Mach 3 razors.\n\nSince moving to Germany, my second attempt was this Merkur 23C, with its weird blade wings thingie.  I used Astra blades because I found an affordable 100-pack at Amazon.de.  The combo works well enough.  The only thing I can't achieve with it is the mythical \"one-stroke shaving\" which wet shaving forums on the Internet preach of.  Like, apparently you're supposed to caress your face with a single Meistestroke with, while following the grain, would close-shave all your beard hairs in one go even as they clean the foam elegantly like an enlightened Zen swordsmonk sweeping a rock garden, leaving nary a shade behind. If stubble is  left at all, it means you suck, but you're allowed to lather up again and draw a second, shameful stroke at a right angle to the grain.  If even then there are still hairs left, you can do a final, desperate stroke against the grain, and then presumably live-stream your seppuku for TheShaveDen elders.\n\nNo matter how I try it, after three strokes not even Jesus would be generous enough to call my face anywhere near \"shaved\".  My shaving process end up looking more like Jackson Pollock's \"Autumn Rhythm\", with dozens of strokes going upwards, downwards, diagonalwards, irregularly around facial features, in Golden Ratio spirals etc.  Despite all this abuse, this razor does not leave me burned or bleeding at all, which I take to be quite the achievement.  It doesn't achieve a close shave either, but then again neither does Mach 3, which costs ten gazillion dollars in the long-term and also makes me bleed a whole lot.\n\nOne day I'll save big bucks, go to some laser hair removal shop of renown, burn every. single. strand of beard hair back to the pits of Hell where they came from, and then post it on Art of Manliness to troll masculinity-worshippers.

Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O.

There are not very many hair dryers like that on the market except ones specifically geared towards my demographic (if you know what I mean). So, this hair dryer fit the bill.

It is made of durable plastic and the pik's teeth are thick and seem to be well constructed. I don't think you'll have a problem with comb breaking at all. Now as for the hair dryer itself, it is a fail. The hair dryer is a very pretty red color and is relatively quiet but its very awkward to hold in your hands for a long period of time. It felt like my hands were sliding off of the handle, not to mention the control buttons are right on the area where you would hold the dryer - definitely annoying. The hair dryer also doesn't seem to get very hot. I need major heat and this was just so-so. I had an Andis dryer before and while my Andis is only 1875 watts it seemed to get my hair much more straighter.

It's juicy, and strong.\n\n  After a few minutes, Artisan evens out with a pleasing floral note (orange blossoms, as I'm told), and you catch hints of aromatic wood and sweet musk.  Sadly, this fades away within an hour or two, and the cologne no longer projects.  If you move in close, you'll detect a feint whiff of what it once was (it smells as if someone lightly dabbed orange peel and vanilla on your skin).\n\n  At $78 retail for the 4.2 oz bottle (I purchased Artisan from a department store), this kills Artisan as a likable product for me.

I am not sure what the actual name of it is.  It is wrapped and glued down with the end tucked up under at the top.  It simply ends at the tip of the handle and is not tucked down.  The surface texture of the wrapped handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate in your hand, although in certain positions it can feel rough.\n\nHOW DOES THIS BRUSH PERFORM?\nAs for performance, this brush does not do too well picking up product from a pan unless the pan of makeup is very very soft and easily picked up.  It does not disperse the product as equally on the skin as I would like.  I have tried this with blush, bronzer and highlighter, but I find that it seems to work best with Guerlain Meteorites.\n\nThat is not necessarily a bad thing as Guerlain Meteorites are little balls of product which are in different colors.  It is hard to find a brush which applies them well.  They act more as a highlight or finishing powder in a very subtle manner.\n\nThis brush would also work decently with mineral makeup.  The tip makes it get into smaller spaces of the face like around the nose and inner eyes, but is broad enough to use on the rest of the face and under the chin.\n\nI did not find that the bristles were dense or sturdy enough to pick up sufficient product to apply to the skin evenly from pans of color such as contour or highlight.\n\nI tend to get better results from brushes in that same shape but much higher density than this one is.\n\nWHAT I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS BRUSH\nMy biggest problem with this brush is that it is not going to be easy to clean.  Brushes are meant to be used and that means they will get dirty.  Sometimes handles will also get dirty.  In the case of this brush, the handle being wrapped by the wicker like pieces, I don't see this brush being easy to clean.  The bristles being wet only is possible, but any moisture at all on this handle is bound to make it come apart eventually.\n\nI imagine if you were to coat the handle with something that would withstand moisture, you could probably still use this brush and it would be more practical.  That way the handle would not unwrap with constant cleaning and you could still enjoy the brush.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nIf used for application of light powdery highlights or contour that is not packed hard in a pan, or sphere powders like Guerlain Meteorites, this brush would be good.  For use where you want to deposit color more evenly from pans of product, it is not the best brush. The composition of the handle makes it not practical to clean as if the handle becomes wet over time, the handle will probably come apart.  It you are a brush collector and love unusual brushes, and the practicality of this does not matter to you, then you might still love this brush.  If you are a practical person who uses their brushes a lot and likes to keep them clean all of the time, this might not be the brush for you.\n\nI have rated this two stars because I feel that it just isn't practical for makeup use that leads to lots of cleaning for that price."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-78160", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Not only did I not like the feel of this primer but after using it with the NuFace Toner, you have to wash it off.

The hair coming back on my arms and legs is more sparse and doesn't come back very quickly.  A week after treatment I had to look carefully at my legs to see if I thought I needed to shave.

I was able to treat my face armpits, top of my forearms and legs all once and my face armpits and one forearm on the 2nd treatment with a cartridge.  When one cartridge \"burned out\" after just that much use I began the 2nd cartridge and counted flashes in sample areas, to see if maybe it really was using 7000-10,000 flashes to cover by body, but it really wasn't and the 2nd cartridge \"burned out\" before I finished a 3rd treatment.  Luckily I had ordered a replacement after the 1st one burned out and it was here to finished my 3rd treatment and do a 4th treatment.  Anyway it wasn't just one \"poor\" cartridge.

I bought this curling iron for my wife, after reading online reviews.  She LOVED this curling iron.  She liked that it heated up fast, opened and closed well, gripped her hair when she wanted it to, and let go when it was supposed to.\n\nI couldn't say exactly when it went from \"love\" to less than that.  But it started probably around the two year mark, after being used on average, about once per week.  It started to not heat up really well, and I think that there had been a flaw of some kind in the power cord, at the point where the cord attaches to the swivel connection on the iron.  There was no visible problem, anywhere on the cord.  It eventually got to the point where it didn't heat at all.  That was probably in this last year, so it was a good 2-3 years old, I would say.\n\nSo this last winter, about 2/2014, I took the thing apart, and couldn't find a thing wrong.  I put it back together and kind of told my wife that it was her imagination--I don't know, I think I was just too busy at the time to be bothered.  Then when I saw her a few weeks later using another old curling iron, and I asked her why she wasn't using the her favorite, and she said it just doesn't work anymore.  So I figured maybe she wasn't making it up :)\n\nI took it apart again, and put an ohm meter on the cord part, and it was not good.  I figured it unlikely that it was in the actual cord.  So I started to cut into the thick part of the cord where it had a reinforced curve in it, and was able to get down to where I found that there must have been a break there.  I cut that part of the cord out, soldered the cord onto the connectors that had been inside that molded reinforced curve, and put all of it back together with epoxy as something of a new homemade connection to reinforce it, and she was off and running again.\n\nThen in just the last few months, probably when the curling iron was about 3 1/2 years old, my wife started complaining that the curling iron was not gripping her hair well enough, and was slipping, and also that it was making a squeaking sound whenever she opened and closed the pincers--don't know if that's the right term.  I am also not sure I understand another comment that she made, though, that she has trouble getting her hair out of it when she finds it is slipping.\n\nAnyway, all of that doesn't matter.  I just looked at the spring area and could see that up underneath where the spring is, the point that contacts the pincer just below the thumb knob, there is a tiny roller that helps the spring to slide quietly back and forth, that was off center, and it also wasn't rolling anymore.  It was mostly sliding.  So I adjusted it to the side a little, and liberally sprayed some dry lubricant on it.  The action works better, and it doesn't make any noise, so we will have to wait until she uses it again to see if it works.\n\nSo as of today 6/16/2014, the iron is still going after approximately 200+ uses, albeit with some required tweaking to keep it out of the garbage.  I would like to believe that the power cord issue that we had was a rare defect, and that most people never run into that.  I'm thinking that most people could use this iron over 200 times and probably just be starting to have a squeaky spring issue, and that's about it.  If I were to have to start this product search again, I would definitely take a chance again on this iron, and hope that we didn't get the cord defect in that reinforced bend near the swivel.\n\nFor the money, and the use that we've had with this, I think it's a great deal.  I actually just realized that we probably have used it many more than 200 times, as we have four girls aged 12 and under as well, but they generally don't get their hair curled, although on some special occasions, several of them do.\n\nDetails on my star rating:\nWhy did I ding this by one star?  Well, although I would buy it again in a second, Amazon's star system equates four stars with a \"like it\" and five stars as a \"love it.\"  I could imagine some engineering tweaks to their design that would eliminate the issues we had.  Also, I saw the inside of it when I was working on it, and although the parts were adequate, I would be cheating a curling iron with better quality parts that deserved the five stars, if I were to give this one five.\n\nAs I've said in other reviews that I've written, to me, either four or five stars is a \"buy with confidence\" in my book.  I wouldn't buy anything again with 1-2 stars on my scale, and a middle-of-the-road three star review by me would be \"your mileage may vary\" and would be a 50/50 shot."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-49460", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Purchased 6/2010, reviewed 6/2014:\n\nWell, better late than never.

There was no visible problem, anywhere on the cord.  It eventually got to the point where it didn't heat at all.  That was probably in this last year, so it was a good 2-3 years old, I would say.\n\nSo this last winter, about 2/2014, I took the thing apart, and couldn't find a thing wrong.  I put it back together and kind of told my wife that it was her imagination--I don't know, I think I was just too busy at the time to be bothered.  Then when I saw her a few weeks later using another old curling iron, and I asked her why she wasn't using the her favorite, and she said it just doesn't work anymore.  So I figured maybe she wasn't making it up :)\n\nI took it apart again, and put an ohm meter on the cord part, and it was not good.  I figured it unlikely that it was in the actual cord.  So I started to cut into the thick part of the cord where it had a reinforced curve in it, and was able to get down to where I found that there must have been a break there.  I cut that part of the cord out, soldered the cord onto the connectors that had been inside that molded reinforced curve, and put all of it back together with epoxy as something of a new homemade connection to reinforce it, and she was off and running again.\n\nThen in just the last few months, probably when the curling iron was about 3 1/2 years old, my wife started complaining that the curling iron was not gripping her hair well enough, and was slipping, and also that it was making a squeaking sound whenever she opened and closed the pincers--don't know if that's the right term.  I am also not sure I understand another comment that she made, though, that she has trouble getting her hair out of it when she finds it is slipping.\n\nAnyway, all of that doesn't matter.  I just looked at the spring area and could see that up underneath where the spring is, the point that contacts the pincer just below the thumb knob, there is a tiny roller that helps the spring to slide quietly back and forth, that was off center, and it also wasn't rolling anymore.  It was mostly sliding.  So I adjusted it to the side a little, and liberally sprayed some dry lubricant on it.  The action works better, and it doesn't make any noise, so we will have to wait until she uses it again to see if it works.\n\nSo as of today 6/16/2014, the iron is still going after approximately 200+ uses, albeit with some required tweaking to keep it out of the garbage.  I would like to believe that the power cord issue that we had was a rare defect, and that most people never run into that.  I'm thinking that most people could use this iron over 200 times and probably just be starting to have a squeaky spring issue, and that's about it.  If I were to have to start this product search again, I would definitely take a chance again on this iron, and hope that we didn't get the cord defect in that reinforced bend near the swivel.\n\nFor the money, and the use that we've had with this, I think it's a great deal.  I actually just realized that we probably have used it many more than 200 times, as we have four girls aged 12 and under as well, but they generally don't get their hair curled, although on some special occasions, several of them do.\n\nDetails on my star rating:\nWhy did I ding this by one star?  Well, although I would buy it again in a second, Amazon's star system equates four stars with a \"like it\" and five stars as a \"love it.\"  I could imagine some engineering tweaks to their design that would eliminate the issues we had.  Also, I saw the inside of it when I was working on it, and although the parts were adequate, I would be cheating a curling iron with better quality parts that deserved the five stars, if I were to give this one five.\n\nAs I've said in other reviews that I've written, to me, either four or five stars is a \"buy with confidence\" in my book.  I wouldn't buy anything again with 1-2 stars on my scale, and a middle-of-the-road three star review by me would be \"your mileage may vary\" and would be a 50/50 shot."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-40478", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "bronzers are out!!!"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-30933", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I cant give this a 5 stars because the packaging was so horrible!

I really don't like having greasy hair.\n\nIm really glad I got to try this stuff. While it goes on like a regular styling cream, once it dries it actually makes your hair softer than before, and yet somehow stays in place. Basically, if you have thick unmanageable hair, this stuff will somehow change your hair on a molecular level to the normal hair of a person that dated in high school.\n\nIt smells fine, but not something you normally associate with hair. Sort of like standing between a hair salon and an Italian restaurant, in terms of scent. I assume that's due to the Rosemary.\n\nSo, given that this stuff is so great, why four stars instead of five? Because its overpriced. Jack Black recently lowered the amount of product, but kept the price the same. The tube you get is far less than half full. Unless they were losing money before, they are price gouging now.  You used to get about 18% more in a bottle than you do now. Unlike a pomade, youll go through a bottle of this fairly quickly with daily use, so I think $15 is a bit high. In fact, it works out to be about as expensive per ounce as the historical value of silver. Or $550 per gallon. No matter how you look at it, this is a lot of money for stuff you put in your hair.

Yes- that is correct, we don't carry them and they are not covered under the warranty as a replacement part.  So I said and I quote \" So what you are telling me, is that if one of your customers  purchases a Babyliss blow dryer, and the concentrator nozzle stops working or breaks, that the consumer is out of luck, I have no options\"  Her answer- \"Yes, that is correct\".
